    "## 1. Loading and preprocessing data\n",
    "In this section, we will implement three types of feature transformation that are known to be relevant for payment card fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "![encoding](experiment/images/encoding_variables.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of transformation involves the date/time variable, and consists in creating binary features that characterize potentially relevant periods. We will create two such features. The first one will characterize whether a transaction occurs during a weekday or during the weekend. The second will characterize whether a transaction occurs during the day or the night. These features can be useful since it has been observed in real-world datasets that fraudulent patterns differ between weekdays and weekends, and between the day and night.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of transformation involves the customer ID and consists in creating features that characterize the customer spending behaviors. We will follow the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) framework proposed in {cite}`VANVLASSELAER201538`, and keep track of the average spending amount and number of transactions for each customer and for three window sizes. This will lead to the creation of six new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type of transformation involves the terminal ID and consists in creating new features that characterize the 'risk' associated with the terminal. The risk will be defined as the average number of frauds that were observed on the terminal for three window sizes. This will lead to the creation of three new features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The table below summarizes the types of transformation that will be performed and the new features that will be created. \n",

    "|TX\\_DATE\\_TIME | Panda timestamp |0 if transaction during a weekday, 1 if transaction during a weekend. The new feature is called TX_DURING_WEEKEND.|1|Integer (0/1)|\n",
    "|TX\\_DATE\\_TIME | Panda timestamp |0 if transaction between 6am and 0pm, 1 if transaction between 0pm and 6am. The new feature is called TX_DURING_NIGHT.|1|Integer (0/1)|\n",
    "|CUSTOMER\\_ID | Categorical variable |Number of transactions by the customer in the last n day(s), for n in {1,7,30}. The new features are called CUSTOMER_ID_NB_TX_nDAY_WINDOW.|3|Integer|\n",
    "|CUSTOMER\\_ID | Categorical variable |Average spending amount in the last n day(s), for n in {1,7,30}. The new features are called CUSTOMER_ID_AVG_AMOUNT_nDAY_WINDOW.|3|Real|\n",
    "|TERMINAL\\_ID | Categorical variable |Number of transactions on the terminal in the last n+d day(s), for n in {1,7,30} and d=7. The parameter d is called delay and will be discussed later in this notebook. The new features are called TERMINAL_ID_NB_TX_nDAY_WINDOW.|3|Integer|\n",

    "\n",
    "The following sections provide the implementation for each of these three transformations. After the transformations, a set of 14 new features will be created. Note that some of the features are the result of aggregation functions over the values of other features or conditions (same customer, given time window). These features are often referred to as *aggregated features*."

    "This section aims at showing how a simple fraud detection system can be designed in a few steps. We will use the simulated data generated in the previous section. For the sake of simplicity, this section will not address the validation part of the baseline supervised learning methodology. The validation part will be covered in later steps. The design of our fraud detection system will consist of three main steps, highlighted in green in Fig. 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining a training set (historical data) and a test set (new data). The training set is the subset of transactions that are used for training the prediction model. The test set is the subset of transactions that are used to assess the performance of the prediction model.\n",
    "2. Training a prediction model: This step consists in using the training set to find a prediction model able to predict whether a transaction is genuine or fraudulent. We will rely for this task on the Python `sklearn` library, which provides easy-to-use functions to train prediction models. \n",

In a fraud detection context, this period separating the training and test set is referred to as the *delay period*. It accounts for the fact that, in a real-world fraud detection system, the label of a transaction (fraudulent or genuine) is only known after a customer complaint, or thanks to the result of a fraud investigation. Therefore, in a realistic scenario, the annotated data available to train a model and start making predictions for a given day are anterior to that day minus the delay period. "

    "Let us finally assess the performance of this decision tree model. We will compute three performance metrics: The AUC ROC, Average Precision (AP), and Card Precision top-$k$ (CP@k).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Card Precision top-$k$ is the most pragmatic and interpretable measure. It takes into account the fact that investigators can only check a maximum of $k$ potentially fraudulent cards per day. It is computed by ranking, for every day in the test set, the most fraudulent transactions, and selecting the $k$ cards whose transactions have the highest fraud probabilities. The precision (proportion of actual compromised cards out of predicted compromised cards) is then computed for each day. The Card Precision top-$k$ is the average of these daily precisions. The number $k$ will be set to $100$ (that is, it is assumed that only 100 cards can be checked every day).\n",
    "* The Average Precision is a proxy for the Card Precision top-$k$, that integrates precisions for all possible $k$ values.\n",
    "* The AUC ROC is an alternative measure to the Average Precision, which gives more importance to scores obtained with higher $k$ values. It is less relevant in practice since the performances that matter most are those for low $k$ values. We however also report it since it is the most widely used performance metric for fraud detection in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all three metrics provide values in the interval $[0,1]$, and that higher values mean better performances. "

    "\n",
    "A model's performance on its training data is a poor predictor of its performance on future data due to overfitting. To address this, validation procedures estimate a model's future performance by splitting past data into a *training set* and a *validation set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fraud detection, this process simulates a real-world scenario where the validation set acts as a proxy for future, unseen transactions. A crucial element is the **delay period**—a gap between the training and validation sets that mimics the real-life time lag required to obtain fraud labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](experiment/images/stream_valid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common validation strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hold-out Validation**: A single split of past data into one training and one validation set.\n",
    "* **Repeated Hold-out Validation**: Repeats the hold-out process multiple times using different data subsets to get a more robust estimate.\n",
    "* **Prequential Validation**: A variant where hold-out validation is repeated by chronologically shifting the training and validation sets through the historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the report, the **prequential validation** offers the most robust way to perform model selection and will be the preferred approach. It should however be noted that it is computationally intensive since it requires the creation of several prediction models for each tested model parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn however offers few possibilities for performing validation on sequential data. In particular, the prequential validation and the Card Precision metric are not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section aims at bridging this gap, by adding both prequential validation and the CP metric to the validation and model selection pipelines provided by sklearn. The benefits will be to gain access to high-level functions from the sklearn library. These include, among others, the ability to \n",
    "\n",
    "* easily parallelize code execution\n",
    "* rely on sklearn *pipelines* for data transformation\n",
    "* rely on different strategies for hyperparameter tuning (exhaustive search, random search, ...). "

The reference starting date for training is set at 2018-07-25, and the deltas to seven days. The performance metrics are the AUC ROC, the Average Precision, and the Card Precision@100. For the sake of conciseness, let us define a `model_selection_wrapper` function, that will perform prequential validation for both the validation and the test sets. "
